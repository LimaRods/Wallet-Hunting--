* All datasets from each perpetua protocol will be consolidated into a final dataset. Each dataset has the following schema:
    - | unique trader | platform | blockchain | vol_all_platform | interaction_coun | last_interact_date (in the last 180 days) | activity (in the last 180 days)
* The file *pipeline.ipynb* is used to clean, prepare and consolidate all outputs from each protocol
